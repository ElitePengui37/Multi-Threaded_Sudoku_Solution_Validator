Project Name: MSSV (Multithreaded Sudoku Solution Validator)

Description: This project takes a completed sudoku puzzle and checks if its solution is valid whilst utilizing multithreading using 4 child threads

How To Compile: Simply enter the directory this file is in in the terminal and type in make (let the file compile everything for you), to decompile type in make clean

How To Run: Type this in the director this program is in after this has been compiled --> ./mssv <Solution file name> <Delay>
	<Solution file name> is the name of the solution file being Solution.txt, Solution2.txt, Solution3.txt, Solution4.txt are the provided files.
	<Delay> is the time in seconds of how long the program sleeps after completing critical sections with the input taking an int between 1-10
	
It is not recommended to run this application in Windows as makefile is wont work with the gcc compiler as well as pthreads being a non Windows threading library
